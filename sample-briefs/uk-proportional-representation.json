    "question": "Should the UK adopt proportional representation instead of first-past-the-post?",
    "relevance": "In 2024, Labour won 63% of Commons seats with 34% of votes, while Reform UK won 14% of votes but 1% of seats. First-past-the-post (FPTP) delivers stable governments but systematically distorts voter preferences. With multi-party politics now the norm and electoral deserts growing (safe seats where millions of votes 'don't count'), the legitimacy of Westminster's electoral system faces unprecedented strain."

  "summaries": {
    "child": "When the UK votes, the person with the most votes in each area wins, even if most people voted for someone else. It's like a class election where someone gets 10 votes and wins, even though 20 kids voted for other people. Some think this is unfair and want 'proportional representation'—where if a party gets 30% of votes, they get 30% of the seats. This would be fairer, but it might mean no party wins and they have to work together, which could be messy!",
    "teen": "The UK uses first-past-the-post (FPTP): whoever gets the most votes in each constituency wins, even with less than 50%. This often means the winning party gets way more seats than their vote share deserves. For example, in 2024 Labour got 63% of seats with only 34% of votes. Proportional representation (PR) would match seats to votes more accurately—if you get 20% of votes, you get about 20% of seats. Countries like Germany and New Zealand use PR. The upside: fairer, more parties represented, fewer 'wasted votes.' The downside: coalition governments are more common (no single party has majority), which some say is unstable or lets small extreme parties have too much power. The UK voted to keep FPTP in a 2011 referendum, but support for PR is growing, especially among younger voters who feel their votes don't matter.",
    "undergrad": "First-past-the-post (FPTP) awards seats to whichever candidate wins a plurality in each constituency, regardless of whether they achieve majority support. This system tends to produce single-party governments and clear accountability but systematically over-represents large parties and under-represents smaller ones. In 2024, Labour's 34% vote share yielded 63% of seats; Reform UK's 14% yielded <1%. Proportional representation (PR) systems—such as party-list PR (Netherlands), mixed-member proportional (Germany), or single transferable vote (Ireland)—allocate seats in proportion to vote shares. Empirical effects of PR include: increased multiparty representation, higher voter turnout (2-5 percentage points), more coalition governments, and greater policy stability (Lijphart, 'Patterns of Democracy', 2012). Critics argue PR fragments parliaments, empowers extremists through coalition leverage, and obscures accountability. Advocates argue FPTP creates 'electoral deserts' (348 of 650 UK seats are safe, Electoral Reform Society 2024), manufactures artificial majorities, and distorts policy toward swing voters in marginal seats. The 2011 UK referendum on Alternative Vote (a weak form of PR) failed 68-32%, but polling (Ipsos 2025) shows 48% now favor PR versus 28% for FPTP, with strong generational divide (18-34: 62% pro-PR).",
    "postdoc": "The FPTP versus PR debate centers on trade-offs between accountability, proportionality, and governability. Duverger's Law posits that FPTP produces two-party systems through strategic voting and mechanical effects (wasted votes), while PR sustains multiparty systems. However, UK's FPTP now generates multiparty outcomes without proportional representation—2024 election saw five parties exceed 10% vote share but only two exceed 10% seat share, violating the Gallagher Index threshold for proportionality (2024: 21.5, indicating extreme disproportionality). Empirical literature (Carey & Hix 2011, Electoral Studies) finds optimal district magnitude for balancing proportionality and accountability is 4-8 seats (Ireland's STV), whereas UK's single-member districts maximize disproportionality. PR's purported instability is overstated: coalition governments in Germany, Netherlands, and New Zealand demonstrate durability (average cabinet survival: Germany 3.2 years, UK 2.8 years post-2010, Strøm et al. 2019). Yet PR's coalition bargaining obscures accountability—voters cannot directly elect or remove governments; small parties (FDP in Germany, NZ First) wield disproportionate influence as kingmakers. The normative question: should electoral systems prioritize faithful representation (PR) or decisive government formation (FPTP)? Lijphart's consensus vs majoritarian democracy framework suggests PR correlates with better governance indicators (inequality, environmental policy) but FPTP with clearer retrospective accountability. UK-specific complication: FPTP entrenched via referendum (2011 AV failure) and Conservative opposition (system benefits them electorally). Transition politics: would existing MPs vote for reform that endangers their seats? Unlikely without crisis or external pressure (Scotland independence, electoral college-style legitimacy crisis). The path dependency problem: FPTP survived because it delivered—until recently—stable single-party governments; once that fails (2010 coalition, 2017 minority, 2024 hollow majority), reform momentum may build."

  "narrative": "The question 'Should the UK adopt proportional representation instead of first-past-the-post?' is not a technical puzzle about vote-counting. It is a question about what democracy is for: faithful representation of the popular will, or decisive government formation? The two goals conflict, and the UK's electoral system has prioritized the latter at the expense of the former.\n\nFirst-past-the-post is elegant in its simplicity: each constituency elects one MP, whoever gets the most votes wins. This delivers—usually—a clear winner and a single-party government with the authority to enact its agenda. For much of the 20th century, this worked tolerably well. Two dominant parties (Labour and Conservative) captured 90%+ of votes, and the distortions of FPTP were tolerable because most voters supported one of the two options. The 1950s-1970s saw regular single-party majorities with 45-50% of the vote, which felt legitimate even if mathematically disproportional.\n\nBut the UK's party system has fragmented. The 2024 general election saw Labour win 63% of seats with 34% of the vote—a lower vote share than any majority government in history. Reform UK won 14% of votes but 0.9% of seats (five MPs out of 650). The Liberal Democrats won 12% of votes and 11% of seats (71 MPs), benefiting from geographic concentration. The Greens won 7% of votes and 0.6% of seats (four MPs). The Gallagher Index, which measures electoral disproportionality, reached 21.5—well into 'extreme' territory (>20).\n\nThis is not an accident. It is FPTP working exactly as designed: over-rewarding large parties with concentrated support, punishing smaller parties with dispersed support. Labour's 34% was enough to win 411 seats because their votes were efficiently distributed across marginal constituencies. Reform's 14% was wasted because their support was spread thinly nationwide—they came second in 98 constituencies but won only five. The system manufactures majorities from minorities.\n\nThe Electoral Reform Society (2024) calculates that 348 of 650 constituencies are 'safe seats' with a >15% margin. In these seats, 22 million voters have no meaningful electoral power—the outcome is predetermined. Turnout in safe seats is systematically lower (58% vs 65% in marginals). Campaigns ignore safe seats. Policy platforms are tailored to swing voters in marginal constituencies (pensioners, homeowners, 'Mondeo Man'), while the preferences of millions in safe seats—urban youth, ethnic minorities, rural conservatives—are structurally irrelevant.\n\nProportional representation promises to solve this. If you win 14% of votes, you get 14% of seats. No more wasted votes; no more safe seats; every voter matters. Countries using PR—Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Ireland—achieve Gallagher Index scores of 2-8 (highly proportional). Voter turnout is consistently 2-5 percentage points higher under PR (Blais & Carty, 1990), because voters believe their choices matter.\n\nYet PR has costs. The most obvious: coalition governments. Germany has never had a single-party majority under its mixed-member proportional system (since 1949). Coalitions require negotiation, compromise, and—critics say—backroom deals that voters never voted for. The 2010 UK coalition between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats illustrated the problem: Lib Dem voters felt betrayed by compromises (tuition fees, austerity), while Tory voters resented sharing power. The Lib Dems were punished brutally in 2015 (57 seats to 8), demonstrating the accountability problem: whom do you blame when two parties govern?\n\nThe counterclaim: German coalitions are stable (average duration 3.2 years vs UK 2.8 years post-2010, per Strøm et al. 2019) and produce consensus policies that weather political transitions. The UK's vaunted 'decisive' governments often enact radical policies (poll tax, Iraq War, austerity) that are reversed or regretted. Is decisiveness a virtue if it enables bad decisions? Perhaps consensus-building, though slower, produces better outcomes.\n\nThe extremism objection: PR gives representation to fringe parties, including neo-Nazis (Germany's AfD has 78 Bundestag seats). Weimar Germany's collapse is often blamed on PR's fragmentation, though historians contest this (the Nazis might have won under any system in 1933). Modern PR democracies manage extremism through 'cordon sanitaire'—mainstream parties refuse to govern with extremists, neutralizing their leverage. FPTP, by contrast, excludes extremists mechanically—Reform UK's 14% buys them almost nothing—but this denial of representation may fuel grievance and delegitimize the system.\n\nThe constituency link is FPTP's great defense. Every voter has 'their' MP, whom they can lobby, hold accountable, and vote out. PR, especially party-list systems, weakens this: voters choose parties, and party leaders decide who gets list seats. This centralization of power in party leadership is anti-democratic. Yet the constituency link is overstated: most MPs vote with their party whip regardless of local views (rebellion rates <5% in most parliaments). And hybrid systems—Germany's MMP or Ireland's STV—maintain local representation while achieving proportionality. Ireland's multi-member STV constituencies (3-5 MPs per district) give voters real choice between candidates, not just parties, while ensuring proportional outcomes.\n\nThe political economy of reform is brutal. Current MPs were elected under FPTP; many sit in safe seats. Why would they vote for a system that endangers their positions? The 2011 referendum on Alternative Vote (a weak form of PR) failed 68-32%, partly because both Labour and Tories opposed it, fearing it would benefit Lib Dems. The Reform Act 1832, which expanded suffrage, passed only under threat of revolution; the Parliament Act 1911, which curbed Lords' power, passed under threat of creating hundreds of new Liberal peers; the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave women the vote, passed after wartime upheaval. Electoral reform, historically, requires crisis or external pressure—not calm deliberation.\n\nYet pressure is building. Ipsos (2025) polling shows 48% favor PR, 28% favor FPTP (rest unsure). Among 18-34s, support for PR is 62%. The 2024 election's disproportionality—Labour's 'landslide' on a 34% vote share—has energized reformers. Scotland and Wales use PR for devolved parliaments, undermining the argument that Westminster must remain FPTP. If Scotland votes for independence, citing Westminster's unrepresentative electoral system as justification, reform pressure will intensify.\n\nWhat should be done? The Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP) system, used in Germany and New Zealand, offers the best balance: 50% of MPs elected via FPTP constituencies (maintaining the local link), 50% from party lists to ensure proportionality. Voters have two votes: one for their local MP, one for a party. The system retains tradition while fixing disproportionality. New Zealand switched from FPTP to MMP in 1996 after a referendum, and subsequent referendums have upheld the change (63% voted to keep MMP in 2011). Public satisfaction with democracy is higher in New Zealand (70%) than the UK (45%).\n\nAlternatively, Single Transferable Vote (STV), used in Ireland, combines proportionality with candidate-centric voting. Voters rank candidates in multi-member constituencies (3-5 MPs per district); seats are allocated proportionally via quota. STV eliminates the party-list cronyism problem—voters choose candidates, not parties—and maintains a local (if slightly larger) constituency link. Ireland's system is complex to count but produces highly proportional outcomes and high voter satisfaction.\n\nA less ambitious reform: the Additional Member System (AMS) with a 5% threshold, as used in Scotland and Wales. This retains 70% of MPs via FPTP, adds 30% from lists for partial proportionality, and excludes micro-parties via a threshold. It is a compromise—less proportional than MMP or STV, but less disruptive than full replacement. It would reduce (but not eliminate) disproportionality, giving Lib Dems, Greens, and Reform modest gains while preserving Labour and Tory dominance.\n\nThe Alternative Vote (AV), rejected in 2011, is the minimalist option: same constituencies, but voters rank candidates, eliminating tactical voting. It is not proportional—large parties still dominate—but it softens FPTP's harshest edges. Australia uses AV with tolerably proportional results. If full PR is politically impossible, AV might be a stepping stone.\n\nThe status quo is unstable. FPTP delivered stable single-party governments because voters accepted the two-party system. As that system fragments—five parties above 10% in 2024—FPTP produces not decisiveness but distortion. A government with 34% of votes and 63% of seats lacks democratic legitimacy. If Reform UK's 14% remains excluded, their voters will radicalize. If Scotland's independence movement frames Westminster as undemocratic (which it is, proportionally), the Union is at risk.\n\nThe first-principles case for PR is overwhelming: democracy means rule by the people, and the people's votes should be reflected in parliament. FPTP's only justification is consequentialist—it produces stable government—but that justification has collapsed. The UK's last three elections (2017 hung parliament, 2019 'stonking majority' on 44%, 2024 'landslide' on 34%) show FPTP delivering neither stability nor legitimacy.\n\nThe barrier is not intellectual but political: MPs elected under FPTP will not vote to abolish it unless forced by referendum, crisis, or a party (Labour?) committed to democratic principle over electoral advantage. The lesson of history: democracy expands not through generosity but through pressure. The question is whether the pressure—disillusionment, fragmentation, Scotland independence, Reform radicalization—will build to a crisis before reform becomes possible. I suspect it will.",
