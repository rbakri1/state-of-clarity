    "question": "Should the UK ban conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ individuals?",
    "relevance": "Conversion therapy—attempts to change sexual orientation or gender identity—affects an estimated 5-7% of UK LGBTQ+ people. While condemned by medical bodies worldwide, it remains legal in England. This tests whether the state should criminalize practices deemed harmful by experts but defended by some on religious freedom grounds."
  },
  "summaries": {
    "child": "Some people think being gay or transgender is wrong and try to 'fix' people through something called conversion therapy. Doctors say this doesn't work and actually hurts people, making them sad and scared. The UK government is thinking about making it illegal, like how bullying is against the rules. But some people say they should be allowed to help people who ask for it, especially if it's part of their religion. It's about whether grown-ups can choose to do something that might hurt them, or if the government should protect everyone from harm.",
    "teen": "Conversion therapy is when someone tries to change a person's sexual orientation (who they're attracted to) or gender identity (whether they feel male, female, or non-binary). It can involve counseling, prayer sessions, or even extreme things like electroshock. Every major medical organization says it doesn't work and causes serious mental health problems—people who go through it are much more likely to attempt suicide. The UK government promised to ban it in 2018, but religious groups argue this would violate their freedom to offer spiritual counseling to people who voluntarily seek help. The debate is about where to draw the line: should adults be free to choose potentially harmful 'therapy,' or should the government ban practices that experts say are pseudoscience and dangerous?",
    "undergrad": "Conversion therapy encompasses practices aimed at suppressing or changing LGBTQ+ identity, ranging from 'talk therapy' to aversion conditioning. The UK government's 2021-2022 proposal to ban it collapsed amid disagreement over scope—particularly whether trans conversion therapy should be included and whether consenting adults should be exempt. Medical evidence is unequivocal: the NHS, British Psychological Society, and Royal College of Psychiatrists condemn it as ineffective and harmful, with survivors reporting depression, PTSD, and suicidality at rates 2-3x higher than baseline LGBTQ+ populations. Opponents invoke religious freedom (Article 9 ECHR) and parental rights, arguing that consensual spiritual counseling should not be criminalized. Legal complexities include defining coercion (can minors truly consent?), distinguishing legitimate counseling from conversion practices, and balancing competing rights claims. Comparative analysis shows 20+ jurisdictions have enacted bans (Malta, Germany, parts of Canada/Australia), providing implementation models.",
    "postdoc": "The conversion therapy debate sits at the intersection of bodily autonomy, medical ethics, religious freedom, and epistemic authority—who determines legitimate therapeutic practice? The empirical case is robust: meta-analyses (Flentje et al. 2020; Turban et al. 2020) demonstrate elevated risk ratios for suicide attempts (aRR 2.3-3.5), depression (aRR 2.1-2.8), and PTSD symptoms among individuals subjected to conversion interventions. Importantly, these associations persist even in analyses adjusting for baseline mental health, suggesting iatrogenic harm rather than selection effects. The UK government's 2022 abandonment of comprehensive legislation—after Conservative backbenchers objected to trans inclusion and religious exemptions—reflects tensions between harm prevention and pluralism. Legal frameworks must navigate Article 9 ECHR (religious freedom) vs. Article 8 (private life) and Article 3 (freedom from degrading treatment), with Strasbourg precedent suggesting proportionate restrictions on religious practice are permissible when protecting vulnerable groups (Eweida 2013, Lee 2018). Comparative jurisdictions reveal design choices: Malta's broad definition captures 'any practice' aimed at change; Germany's 2020 law prohibits commercially-offered therapy but exempts religious counseling not involving conversion intent; Canada's proposed Bill C-6 criminalizes causing minors to undergo conversion therapy, sidestepping adult consent issues. Enforcement mechanisms vary from professional sanctions (license revocation) to criminal penalties (fines, imprisonment), with implications for deterrence vs. martyrdom dynamics."

  "narrative": "The question of whether to ban conversion therapy is not primarily empirical—the medical evidence is overwhelming and uncontested among credible institutions. Every major professional body, from the NHS to the British Psychological Society to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, condemns conversion therapy as ineffective and harmful. Turban et al.'s 2020 study found individuals subjected to conversion efforts had 2.3 times higher odds of lifetime suicide attempts, even after adjusting for baseline mental health. Coventry University's 2021 UK survey revealed that 51% of conversion therapy survivors attempted suicide, and 90% reported lasting psychological harm.\n\nThe debate, then, is not about evidence but about values: religious freedom, parental rights, adult autonomy, and the limits of state paternalism. This is a collision between incommensurable frameworks.\n\nFrom a harm-prevention perspective, the case for a comprehensive ban is straightforward. If a practice demonstrably causes severe psychological harm—depression, PTSD, suicidality—with no countervailing therapeutic benefit, the state has a duty to prohibit it, particularly when it targets vulnerable minors. We don't permit parents to subject children to bloodletting or exorcisms as medical treatment; why should conversion therapy be different? The analogy to female genital mutilation (FGM) is instructive: the UK banned FGM despite cultural and religious justifications, and despite claims that some adult women consent. The principle is that certain harms are so severe and so clearly non-therapeutic that consent—even adult consent—is insufficient justification.\n\nYet the religious freedom objection cannot be dismissed as mere bigotry. For many religious communities, homosexuality and gender transition conflict with deeply held theological convictions. Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects not just belief but the manifestation of belief through practice. If a pastor offers prayer counseling to a congregant experiencing 'unwanted same-sex attraction,' is this not religious practice deserving protection? The Evangelical Alliance argues that bans would criminalize pastoral care, forcing churches to affirm what they believe to be sinful.\n\nThe legal question is whether prohibiting conversion therapy constitutes a proportionate interference with religious freedom under Article 9(2). Strasbourg case law establishes that religious freedom is not absolute: restrictions are permissible if they serve a legitimate aim (protecting health and rights of others) and are necessary and proportionate. In Eweida (2013) and Lee (2018), the court upheld religious practice restrictions when they conflicted with anti-discrimination protections. The harm documented in conversion therapy studies—elevated suicide risk, trauma symptoms—arguably justifies restriction as protecting a vulnerable group.\n\nBut the definitional challenge is real. How do we distinguish conversion therapy from legitimate counseling? If a therapist helps a client explore gender dysphoria without assuming transition is the only outcome, is that conversion therapy? The UK government's 2022 consultation revealed 58% of respondents identified definition as a key concern. Malta's law defines conversion therapy broadly as 'any practice' aimed at changing identity—clear, but potentially overbroad. Germany's law requires 'commercial' provision, exempting religious counseling—narrower, but creates loopholes.\n\nThe gender identity dimension adds another layer of complexity. The UK government's 2022 proposal initially included trans people, but Conservative MPs threatened rebellion, arguing that banning 'trans conversion therapy' would criminalize therapists helping detransitioners or questioning youth explore feelings without social pressure. This concern, while sometimes weaponized by anti-trans activists, has a kernel of legitimacy: if a teenager experiencing gender dysphoria wants to explore underlying factors (trauma, autism, social contagion) without being steered toward immediate transition, should therapists be free to facilitate that exploration? The question is whether this can be distinguished from conversion therapy that assumes dysphoria is pathological and seeks to eliminate it.\n\nThe medical consensus is that affirmative therapy—accepting the client's identity as valid while exploring their feelings—is distinct from conversion therapy, which presumes pathology. But in practice, the line is contested. The Cass Review (2024) into NHS gender services recommended more 'exploratory' approaches for youth, prompting accusations from some trans advocates that exploration itself is conversion therapy. This conflation makes trans inclusion politically toxic, as evidenced by the UK government's 2022 withdrawal of legislation.\n\nThe adult consent issue further complicates matters. Liberal principles generally hold that competent adults should be free to make self-regarding choices, even harmful ones (smoking, skydiving, cosmetic surgery). Why should conversion therapy be different? The counter-argument is that 'consent' to conversion therapy is rarely free: it's coerced by family pressure, religious indoctrination, or internalized homophobia. The analogy is to FGM, where adult women's 'consent' is deemed irrelevant because the practice is inherently harmful and choice is vitiated by social pressure. Yet this paternalistic logic—we ban X because people's choices aren't truly free—is a slippery slope. Who decides which choices are sufficiently autonomous?\n\nComparative jurisdictions offer lessons. Malta's comprehensive ban (2016) has faced no successful legal challenges and has symbolic weight, even if enforcement is limited. Germany's narrow law (2020) protects minors but exempts religious counseling, limiting effectiveness. Victoria, Australia's ban (2021) includes adults and trans people, with civil enforcement showing early success. Canada's Bill C-6 criminalizes causing minors to undergo conversion therapy, sidestepping adult consent debates—but it stalled in parliament for years.\n\nThe political economy suggests a phased approach may be most viable in the UK context. Begin with a narrow ban: criminalize conversion therapy for minors, covering both sexual orientation and gender identity, with no parental consent defense. This protects the most vulnerable, has strong public support (64% in 2021 polls), and avoids adult autonomy debates. Couple it with professional sanctions (license revocation) for regulated practitioners offering conversion therapy to adults. After 5-7 years, review evidence: if adult conversion therapy remains widespread and harmful, extend the criminal ban; if professional sanctions suffice, maintain equilibrium.\n\nThis gradualist approach balances competing values: prioritizes child protection, respects (some) adult autonomy, minimizes religious freedom conflicts, and builds evidence base. But it's morally unsatisfying to those who see conversion therapy as inherently abusive—half-measures perpetuate harm. The purist position: ban it all, immediately, comprehensively. The pragmatic position: protect minors first, build political consensus, expand later if needed.\n\nThe first-principles question is whether liberal democracies should permit harmful practices in the name of autonomy and pluralism. My answer: not when the harm is severe, the victims are vulnerable, and the practice has no legitimate therapeutic basis. Conversion therapy meets all three criteria. The state should ban it comprehensively, accept the legal challenges, and defend the ban as protecting human dignity against pseudoscientific harm. But I acknowledge this is a values judgment, not a logical necessity. Those who prioritize religious freedom and adult autonomy over harm prevention will disagree—and their position, while I think mistaken, is not obviously irrational.",
