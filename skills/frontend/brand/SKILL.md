## Brand Identity

### Brand Essence
**Core Purpose:**
Raise the quality of political debate in the UK by transforming complex policy questions into transparent, evidence-based briefs that serve everyone from children to postdoctoral researchers.

**Vision:**
A UK where citizens make informed political decisions based on evidence and first-principles reasoning, not viral hot takes and echo chambers.

**Mission:**
Generate AI-powered policy briefs that deliver multi-layered answers to any political question, with full source transparency and accessibility across education levels.

**Values:**
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Make the complex navigable, not simple
- **Evidence over Opinion:** Every claim backed by credible sources
- **Transparency over Mystification:** Show the work, cite everything
- **Depth over Speed:** Take time to get it right (60s generation is fast enough)
- **Accessibility over Gatekeeping:** Serve 8-year-olds and PhDs equally well
- **Community over Authority:** Truth emerges from collective scrutiny
- **First Principles over Assumptions:** Build reasoning from foundations
- **Rigour over Partisanship:** Truth-seeking, not "both sides are equal"

## Brand Personality

### Voice: Rigorous but Approachable
- We sound: Like a thoughtful researcher explaining complex ideas over coffee
- NOT: Academic jargon or patronizing simplification
- Example: "Here's what the evidence actually shows..." not "Studies suggest..."

### Tone: Transparent but Confident
- We sound: Honest about uncertainty while clear about what we know
- NOT: Hedging everything with "it's complicated" without clarity
- Example: "We don't have enough data on X, but here's what we can say about Y..."

### Voice: Systematic but Engaging
- We sound: Organized thinking that draws you in
- NOT: Dry bullet points or flashy clickbait
- Example: "Let's build this from the ground up. First, what even is a 'state'?"
