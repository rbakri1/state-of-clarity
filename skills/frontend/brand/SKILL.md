# State of Clarity - Brand Guidelines

## Purpose
This skill defines the State of Clarity brand identity – how we sound, look, and present ourselves to build trust in an era of political noise.

## Brand Identity

### Brand Essence

**Core Purpose:**
Raise the quality of political debate in the UK by transforming complex policy questions into transparent, evidence-based briefs that serve everyone from children to postdoctoral researchers.

**Vision:**
A UK where citizens make informed political decisions based on evidence and first-principles reasoning, not viral hot takes and echo chambers.

**Mission:**
Generate AI-powered policy briefs that deliver multi-layered answers to any political question, with full source transparency and accessibility across education levels.

**Values:**
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Make the complex navigable, not simple
- **Evidence over Opinion:** Every claim backed by credible sources
- **Transparency over Mystification:** Show the work, cite everything
- **Depth over Speed:** Take time to get it right (60s generation is fast enough)
- **Accessibility over Gatekeeping:** Serve 8-year-olds and PhDs equally well
- **Community over Authority:** Truth emerges from collective scrutiny
- **First Principles over Assumptions:** Build reasoning from foundations
- **Rigour over Partisanship:** Truth-seeking, not "both sides are equal"

## Brand Personality

### Design Principle
**Words lead. Colour supports. Typography carries authority quietly.**

### Mood
Thoughtful, rigorous, humane, editorial

**Not:** Activist, corporate, academic-for-academics

### Voice Characteristics

**Rigorous but Approachable:**
- We sound: Like a thoughtful researcher explaining complex ideas over coffee
- NOT: Academic jargon or patronizing simplification
- Example: "Here's what the evidence actually shows..." not "Studies suggest..."

**Transparent but Confident:**
- We sound: Honest about uncertainty while clear about what we know
- NOT: Hedging everything with "it's complicated" without clarity
- Example: "We don't have enough data on X, but here's what we can say about Y..."

**Systematic but Engaging:**
- We sound: Organized thinking that draws you in
- NOT: Dry bullet points or flashy clickbait
- Example: "Let's build this from the ground up. First, what even is a 'state'?"

**Inclusive but Substantive:**
- We sound: Welcoming to all levels while maintaining intellectual depth
- NOT: Dumbed down or inaccessible to non-experts
- Example: Child level is genuinely helpful, not condescending

**Non-partisan but Principled:**
- We sound: Committed to truth-seeking, not false balance
- NOT: "Both sides" journalism or politically coded language
- Example: "The evidence shows X, though Y remains contested"

## Visual Brand Identity

### Core Direction

**Aesthetic:** Warm editorial - like The Economist meets Our World in Data
**Character:** Thoughtful, rigorous, humane, sophisticated
**Feel:** Modern research library meets data journalism

### Primary Colors

**Deep Sage** - `#5E6F64`
- Meaning: Calm, grounded, non-tribal, serious without austerity
- Primary use: Links, section markers, UI affordances, focus rings
- Emotional association: Thoughtful, balanced, trustworthy
- Why: Non-partisan, sophisticated, editorial authority

**Muted Rust** - `#9A5A3A`
- Meaning: Warmth, emphasis, human touch
- Primary use: One-off emphasis, key callouts, occasional charts
- Emotional association: Warm, distinctive, approachable
- Why: Balances cool sage, adds warmth without aggression
- **Rule:** If using often, you're using it wrong (≤5% of design)

**Smoke Blue** - `#6E7F8D` (Optional)
- Meaning: Cool counterbalance, data visualization
- Primary use: Charts, diagrams, subtle differentiation
- Why: Visual variety without "blue politics"

### Base Neutrals (Foundation)

**Warm Ivory** - `#F7F4EF`
- Primary page background (replaces pure white)
- Softer than white, reduces glare, feels human

**Light Stone** - `#ECE7DF`
- Secondary backgrounds, section separation

**Warm Linen** - `#E1DBD2`
- Card surfaces, elevated content
- Feels tactile, not flat

**Soft Taupe** - `#CFC8BD`
- Borders, dividers
- Visible without shouting

### Text Colors (Ink-Based Blacks)

**Soft Ink** - `#1F2328`
- **Primary body text** - essays, long reads, headings
- Not pure black (too aggressive)
- Reduces eye fatigue, feels considered

**Warm Charcoal** - `#3A3F45`
- Secondary text, subheads, captions

**Stone Grey** - `#6B6F73`
- Meta text, dates, labels, footnotes

**Ash Grey** - `#9A9E9F`
- Disabled/de-emphasized UI elements

### Color Philosophy

**Hard Rules:**
- **No pure white** (#FFFFFF) - harsh, digital
- **No pure black** (#000000) - aggressive, undermines warmth
- **Neutrals: 80-85%** of any design
- **Accents: ≤5%** - if color is noticeable, reduce
- **Color is semantic** - purposeful, not decorative

**Principle:** If color starts being noticeable, you've gone too far.

## Typography

### Font Philosophy

**Serif for depth, sans for clarity**

Editorial sites use serif for body text because it:
- Signals seriousness and substance
- Better for long-form reading (800-1200 words)
- Pairs naturally with warm neutrals
- Conveys intellectual depth

### Font Families

**Headings (Warm Editorial Authority):**
```
Canela (ideal)
→ Tiempos Headline (alternative)
→ Libre Baskerville (free alternative)
→ Cormorant Garamond (classical alternative)
```

**Why Canela:**
- Warm, intellectual, contemporary serif
- Widely used in high-end editorial
- Signals depth without stuffiness

**Body Text (Long Reading):**
```
Source Serif 4 (ideal - free, excellent)
→ Literata (Google Fonts alternative)
```

**Why Source Serif:**
- Optimized for screens
- Excellent readability at 18px
- Free, professional quality
- Pairs perfectly with warm backgrounds

**UI/Meta (Contrast & Clarity):**
```
Inter (ideal)
→ Source Sans 3 (alternative)
```

**Why Inter:**
- Modern, professional
- Prevents serif overload
- Perfect for navigation, captions, buttons
- Adds quiet professionalism

### Type Hierarchy

**Primary Body:** 18px Source Serif, Soft Ink (#1F2328), 1.6 line-height
**Headings:** 42px Canela, Soft Ink, font-semibold
**Meta/Captions:** 14px Inter, Stone Grey (#6B6F73)

## Messaging Principles

### Primary Message
**"See politics clearly. Decide wisely."** – We transform political complexity into navigable clarity.

### Supporting Messages

1. **Evidence-Based:** Every claim is sourced. Every source is scored for credibility and political lean.
2. **Multi-Layered:** Understand at your level – child, teen, undergrad, or postdoc. No gatekeeping.
3. **Transparent:** See our work. Challenge our sources. Improve our briefs. Collaborative truth-seeking.
4. **First Principles:** We build reasoning from foundations, not assumptions. Question everything, including us.

### Writing Guidelines

**Do:**
- ✅ Use active voice ("We found 18 sources" not "18 sources were found")
- ✅ Lead with evidence, not opinion ("The ONS data shows..." not "Many believe...")
- ✅ Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly ("We don't know X, but here's Y")
- ✅ Use concrete examples over abstractions
- ✅ Address the reader as intelligent but not necessarily expert
- ✅ Show reasoning steps ("First... Then... Therefore...")
- ✅ Cite everything with inline links

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use partisan dog whistles (avoid politically coded terms)
- ❌ Make unsubstantiated claims (if you can't source it, don't say it)
- ❌ Oversimplify for brevity (complexity is fine, confusion is not)
- ❌ Use academic jargon without explanation
- ❌ Create false balance ("some say X, others say Y" without evidence weight)

### Banned Words/Phrases

These undermine our brand of transparent, evidence-based analysis:

- ❌ **"Unbiased"** (impossible; we're transparent instead)
- ❌ **"Objective truth"** (we say "evidence-based conclusions")
- ❌ **"Both sides"** (there may be many sides, not two)
- ❌ **"Experts agree"** (appeal to authority without evidence)
- ❌ **"It's complicated"** (without then explaining it)

### Preferred Vocabulary

**Use instead:**
- "Evidence shows" (not "some say")
- "First principles" (not "common sense")
- "Politically left/center/right" (not partisan labels)
- "Clarity score" (not "quality score" - clarity is our brand)
- "Sources" (not "references" - more approachable)
- "Reading level" (not "difficulty level" - not a test)

## The 4 Reading Levels

### Philosophy
Different audiences need different entry points to complexity. All levels deserve intellectual respect.

### Child (8-12 years)
- **Length:** 150-250 words
- **Voice:** Curious teacher explaining to a smart kid
- **Typography:** 19px, 1.65 line-height (extra space for developing readers)
- **Analogies:** Relatable (playground, family, school)
- **Example:** "Imagine if your school had to decide..." (not baby talk)
- **Principle:** Genuine respect for young readers, no condescension

### Teen (13-17 years)
- **Length:** 250-400 words
- **Voice:** Engaged mentor discussing real-world complexity
- **Typography:** 18px, 1.6 line-height
- **Context:** References current events they'd know
- **Example:** Social media, pop culture connections without pandering

### Undergrad (18-22 years)
- **Length:** 400-600 words
- **Voice:** Professor introducing a topic with nuance
- **Typography:** 18px, 1.6 line-height
- **Depth:** Introduce key concepts, show trade-offs
- **Example:** Begin introducing academic frameworks, data analysis

### Postdoc (Graduate researchers)
- **Length:** 600-1000 words
- **Voice:** Peer discussion among experts
- **Typography:** 18px, 1.55 line-height (slightly tighter for density)
- **Rigor:** Full complexity, technical terminology, methodological notes
- **Example:** Discuss research gaps, data limitations, scholarly debates

**Note:** All levels use same font size (18px) but adjust line-height for reading comfort.

---

## Source Transparency

### Core Principle
Every brief must show sources transparently. This is non-negotiable.

**Every Brief Must:**
- Show source diversity breakdown (left/center/right percentages)
- Display credibility scores (0-10) with methodology explained
- Link directly to sources (not aggregators)
- Prefer primary sources (≥40% of total)
- Flag paywalled sources with indicator
- Show last updated timestamp
- Make version history available (if edited)

### Citation Format

**Inline (in narrative):**
```
[Superscript number]¹ linking to source
```

**Footer (source details):**
```
¹ Office for National Statistics (2024) - "UK Labour Market Report"
  Credibility: 10/10 | Lean: Center | Type: Government Data
  https://ons.gov.uk/...
```

### Source Metadata Display

Every source shows:
- **Title** (linked to original)
- **Political Lean** (left/center-left/center/center-right/right/unknown)
- **Credibility Score** (0-10, methodology visible)
- **Source Type** (primary/secondary/tertiary)
- **Publication Date** (if available)
- **Paywall Status** (flagged with icon)

---

## Brand Applications

### User Interface
- Prioritize clarity and navigability over visual flair
- Use whitespace generously (80-85% neutral colors)
- Progressive disclosure: Start simple, reveal depth on demand
- Always show sources inline (never hide citations)
- Optimize for reading 800-1200 word essays
- Ensure WCAG AAA contrast for body text

### Marketing Materials
- Lead with the problem ("Political discourse is broken")
- Show the solution visually (multi-level reading, citation graphs)
- Use real data from real briefs (not stock illustrations)
- Highlight transparency ("Here's exactly how we work")
- Avoid marketing speak ("revolutionary", "AI-powered" as selling point)

### Community Engagement
- Encourage constructive critique ("Spot an error? Help us fix it.")
- Reward quality contributions (reputation points, badges)
- Be transparent about errors ("We updated this brief based on your feedback")
- Moderate for civility, not viewpoint

---

## Brand Don'ts - Critical

❌ **Never:**
- Use pure white (#FFFFFF) or pure black (#000000)
- Use political party colors (red/blue) as primary brand colors
- Make partisan claims about current politicians
- Hide methodology or make "black box" claims
- Use AI as a selling point without explaining how
- Compromise accessibility for aesthetics
- Engage in culture war topics without rigorous sourcing
- Use color for decoration (color is always semantic)
- Let accents exceed 5% of design
- Use saturated primaries

---

## Reference Examples

**Good Examples (Editorial Authority):**
- **The Economist:** Data-driven, rigorous, warm serif typography
- **Our World in Data:** Evidence visualization, accessible explanations, open methodology
- **Financial Times:** Warm editorial palette, sophisticated analysis
- **Stratechery:** Layered analysis, first principles, clear reasoning

**Examples to Avoid:**
- **Partisan news sites:** Hidden methodology, echo chamber design
- **Social media hot takes:** Viral over accurate, emotion over evidence
- **Academic papers:** Inaccessible jargon, paywalled, no layering
- **"Explainer" sites:** Oversimplified, lose nuance, no source diversity

---

## Voice Examples

### Homepage Copy
**Good:**
"Political debates are full of heat, but often lacking in light. State of Clarity transforms any policy question into evidence-based briefs with four reading levels, transparent sources, and first-principles reasoning. See politics clearly. Decide wisely."

**Bad:**
"Revolutionary AI-powered platform disrupts political discourse! Our cutting-edge technology delivers unbiased insights from multiple perspectives. Join thousands making smarter decisions!"

### Brief Introduction
**Good:**
"This brief examines whether the UK should adopt a 4-day work week. We analyzed 18 sources across the political spectrum, from government studies to think tank research to employer trials. Here's what the evidence shows, what remains uncertain, and how to think about the trade-offs."

**Bad:**
"Experts disagree on the 4-day work week debate. Some say it boosts productivity, others warn of costs. This comprehensive analysis presents both sides so you can decide for yourself."

### Error Message
**Good:**
"We couldn't find enough high-quality sources on this topic. Try rephrasing your question – for example, 'UK housing policy' works better than 'housing in Swindon'. Or suggest sources you know about and we'll incorporate them."

**Bad:**
"Search failed. Please try again."

## Final Brand Statement

**State of Clarity is the entrepreneur's answer to political discourse.**

We're building a product where:
- Evidence matters more than outrage
- Complexity is navigable, not simplified
- Transparency builds trust
- Community improves quality
- First principles beat assumptions
- Accessibility doesn't mean dumbing down
- Warmth doesn't mean weakness

Our brand reflects these values in every word, design choice, and interaction.

**We're not "unbiased" – we're transparent.**
**We're not "objective" – we're evidence-based.**
**We're not "neutral" – we're rigorous.**

And that makes all the difference.
