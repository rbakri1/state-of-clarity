Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019baea4-e766-7534-a4e4-67322408fcac
- Created privacy policy page at /app/privacy/page.tsx
- Page includes all required sections: What data we collect, How we use it, Third parties (Supabase, Stripe, Vercel), User rights (export, delete), Contact info
- Footer already contained link to /privacy
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Privacy page already existed in untracked files from previous work
  - Footer in app/page.tsx already has Legal section with privacy link

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019baea6-cb9b-72dd-8360-3bfcad0551c2
- Created terms of service page at /app/terms/page.tsx
- Page includes sections: Acceptance of Terms, User Responsibilities, Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability, Termination, Dispute Resolution, Contact Us
- Uses simple, readable language (not legalese)
- Added Terms of Service link to footer in app/page.tsx
- Cleaned up duplicate files (brief-service 2.ts, safe-query 2.ts) that were causing build failures
- Build passes successfully
- Browser verification passed: title, sections, and footer link confirmed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Duplicate files with " 2" suffix can cause build failures - clean them up before running builds
  - Follow privacy page structure/styling for consistency on legal pages

- Created cookie consent banner component at /components/cookie-consent-banner.tsx
- Banner appears at bottom of screen with fixed positioning (z-50)
- Includes message about cookies (analytics, functionality)
- Accept and Decline buttons with proper styling
- Links to privacy policy from banner
- Added CookieConsentBanner to root layout.tsx
- Typecheck passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Client components in Next.js need "use client" directive at top
  - This codebase does not have a /components folder - had to create it
  - Use localStorage for client-side persistence

- Fixed cookie consent persistence to properly store and retrieve JSON format
- Consent stored as JSON object: {value: "accepted"|"declined", timestamp: ISO string}
- Added `getStoredConsent()` that parses JSON and falls back to legacy string format
- Added exported utilities: `getConsentStatus()` and `hasAcceptedCookies()` for other components
- Banner correctly hidden when consent already exists in localStorage
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cookie consent uses JSON format in localStorage for audit trail: `{value, timestamp}`
  - Use `hasAcceptedCookies()` from cookie-consent-banner.tsx to check before loading analytics
