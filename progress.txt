## Codebase Patterns
- Database types are defined in lib/supabase/client.ts (not a separate types.ts file)
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations to make them idempotent
- RLS policies: users can SELECT their own, service_role can manage all
- Credit amounts: positive = purchase/refund/bonus, negative = usage/expiry

- Created migration 008_add_credits_tables.sql with 4 tables:
  - credit_packages: purchasable credit bundles
  - user_credits: per-user balance tracking
  - credit_batches: individual purchases with expiry dates
  - credit_transactions: audit log of all movements
- Added TypeScript types to Database interface in client.ts
- Fixed pre-existing type errors in app/brief/[id]/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The prd.json and progress.txt get stashed when switching branches - be careful with git stash/checkout
  - Pre-existing type errors need to be fixed before build passes
  - Database types live in client.ts on this branch (not a separate types.ts)
