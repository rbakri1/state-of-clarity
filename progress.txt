## Codebase Patterns
- Agent persona files export string constants for system prompts (see specialist-personas.ts and accountability-personas.ts for patterns)
- Types for accountability features are in lib/types/accountability.ts
- Use @langchain/langgraph for state machine orchestration (already in dependencies)

- Created centralized system prompts for all 5 accountability tracker agents
- File created: lib/agents/accountability-personas.ts
- Prompts: ENTITY_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT (99 words), UK_PROFILE_RESEARCH_PROMPT (411 words), CORRUPTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT (362 words), ACTION_LIST_GENERATION_PROMPT (329 words)
- All prompts use conditional language and include ethical framing
- Corruption prompt mandates innocentExplanations for every scenario
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing test files have pre-existing type errors (unrelated to this work)
  - Follow the pattern in specialist-personas.ts for persona exports
