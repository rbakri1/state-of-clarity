- What was implemented: Header navigation already had Briefs and Investigations links correctly configured
- Files changed: components/layout/header.tsx (verified existing implementation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Header nav links are defined in navLinks array in components/layout/header.tsx
  - Use `npm run type-check` (not `typecheck`) for this project
  - Test file type errors exist in __tests__/unit/services/ but don't block component work
