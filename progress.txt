## Codebase Patterns
- Use explicit type annotations in .map() callbacks to avoid implicit any errors
- Types can be defined in /lib/types/ directory as separate modules
- Quality gate tiers: high (≥8.0), acceptable (6.0-7.9), failed (<6.0)
- Supabase type workarounds: use `as never` for insert/update, type assertions on .single() results

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba510-b8ef-74c1-88b7-6e4f6f37396e
- Implemented quality gate types and interfaces in /lib/types/quality-gate.ts
- Defined QualityTier enum with HIGH, ACCEPTABLE, FAILED values
- Created QualityGateResult interface with tier, finalScore, attempts, publishable, warningBadge, refundRequired
- Created RetryQueueItem interface with briefId, originalQuestion, classification, failureReason, retryParams, scheduledAt, attempts, status
- Created RetryParams interface and RetryStatus type
- Added helper functions: getQualityTier() and createQualityGateResult()
- Fixed pre-existing implicit any type errors in app/brief/[id]/page.tsx
- Files changed: lib/types/quality-gate.ts (new), app/brief/[id]/page.tsx (type fixes)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pre-existing type errors in the codebase need to be fixed when switching branches
  - Use explicit type annotations in .map() callbacks: `(item: Type, i: number) =>`
  - Use `as Record<string, Type>` cast for Object.entries() with JSONB fields

- Implemented quality gate orchestrator in /lib/agents/quality-gate.ts
- runQualityGate() orchestrates: consensus scoring -> threshold check -> refinement loop -> final decision
- runConsensusScoring() uses 3 evaluator agents (Clarity Expert, Evidence Analyst, Objectivity Judge)
- runRefinementLoop() targets the lowest scorer's feedback for improvements
- getTierDecision() helper for logging tier classification with reasoning
- MAX_REFINEMENT_ATTEMPTS = 3 before declaring failure
- Files changed: lib/agents/quality-gate.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Quality gate uses Claude Haiku for consensus scoring (cheaper) and Sonnet for refinement (better quality)
  - The 3 evaluators run in parallel via Promise.all for performance
  - JSON extraction from Claude uses regex match /\{[\s\S]*\}/ pattern

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba518-0b34-7729-8d4a-e09627893ffe
- Verified tiered publishing logic in quality-gate.ts
- Updated runQualityGate() to use getTierDecision() for logging decisions with reasoning
- Tier logic: HIGH (≥8.0) → publishable, no warning; ACCEPTABLE (6.0-7.9) → publishable with warning; FAILED (<6.0) → not publishable, refund required
- Files changed: lib/agents/quality-gate.ts (updated import and logging)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - getTierDecision() returns reasoning string that should be logged for debugging
  - createQualityGateResult() handles all tier determination logic based on score

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba519-957f-756e-b7fa-ad8b4c99564f
- Created retry_queue table migration in /lib/supabase/migrations/005_add_retry_queue_table.sql
- Table columns: id, brief_id, original_question, classification (JSONB), failure_reason, retry_params (JSONB), scheduled_at, attempts, status, created_at
- Status values: 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'abandoned'
- Added indexes for efficient queue polling (status, scheduled_at)
- Updated Database interface in client.ts with retry_queue Row/Insert/Update types
- Files changed: lib/supabase/migrations/005_add_retry_queue_table.sql (new), lib/supabase/client.ts (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Migrations go in /lib/supabase/migrations/ directory (create if needed)
  - Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotent migrations
  - Database interface in client.ts needs Row, Insert, and Update types for each table

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba51b-805c-701c-bf0b-6557f8de65d8
- Implemented retry queue service in /lib/services/retry-queue-service.ts
- Created addToRetryQueue(): adds failed brief to queue with 1 hour retry delay
- Created getNextRetryItem(): fetches next pending item ready for processing
- Created markRetryComplete(): marks retry as completed, pending for re-retry, or abandoned after 2 attempts
- Created generateRetryParams(): generates retry parameters based on failure reason (low evidence, low objectivity, low clarity)
- Files changed: lib/services/retry-queue-service.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use type aliases for Supabase table types: `type RetryQueueRow = Database["public"]["Tables"]["retry_queue"]["Row"]`
  - Use `as never` cast for Supabase `.insert()` and `.update()` calls when types don't align properly
  - Use explicit type assertions on `.single()` results: `as { data: RowType | null; error: { message: string } | null }`

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba51e-38f9-777d-a659-42f3f73f3a98
- Implemented retry executor agent in /lib/agents/retry-executor.ts
- Created processNextRetry(): picks pending items from queue where scheduled_at <= now
- Created executeRetryWithAdjustedParams(): runs full brief generation with adjusted params
- Created adjustParametersForRetry(): adjusts params based on failure reason (low evidence, low objectivity, low clarity)
- Created gatherSourcesWithAdjustedParams(): uses research agent with adjusted source requirements
- Created generateBriefWithAdjustedParams(): generates brief with persona and prompt adjustments
- Created processAllPendingRetries(): batch processes all pending retries
- Max 2 retry attempts before marking as 'abandoned' (handled by markRetryComplete in retry-queue-service)
- Files changed: lib/agents/retry-executor.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Retry executor uses researchAgent() for source gathering and runQualityGate() for evaluation
  - Different specialist personas are cycled: "Investigative Journalist", "Policy Analyst", "Research Scholar"
  - On second attempt, all adjustment params are forced (increased sources, opposing views)

- Created credit service placeholder in /lib/services/credit-service.ts
- Implemented refundCredits(userId, amount, reason, briefId?): logs refund and records to database
- Created migration /lib/supabase/migrations/006_add_credit_refunds_table.sql
- Table has: id, user_id, amount, reason, brief_id, created_at with RLS policies
- Updated Database interface in client.ts with credit_refunds Row/Insert/Update types
- Files changed: lib/services/credit-service.ts (new), lib/supabase/migrations/006_add_credit_refunds_table.sql (new), lib/supabase/client.ts (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Credit service is a placeholder for Theme 6 - actual credit deduction/balance not yet implemented
  - Service logs refund action and records to database for audit trail
