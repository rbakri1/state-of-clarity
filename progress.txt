## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run type-check` (not `typecheck`) for this project
- Test file type errors exist in __tests__/unit/ but don't block component work
- For accountability_investigations table, use cast to `ReturnType<typeof supabase.from>` (table not in types yet)
- Check error field when querying tables that may not exist - handle gracefully with fallback to 0

- What was implemented: Header navigation already had Briefs and Investigations links correctly configured
- Files changed: components/layout/header.tsx (verified existing implementation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Header nav links are defined in navLinks array in components/layout/header.tsx
  - Use `npm run type-check` (not `typecheck`) for this project
  - Test file type errors exist in __tests__/unit/services/ but don't block component work

- What was implemented: Added investigations count fetch to profile page
- Files changed: app/profile/page.tsx
  - Added `investigationsCount` to ProfileStats interface
  - Added query to accountability_investigations table in Promise.all
  - Used type cast and error handling for graceful fallback
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - accountability_investigations table not in Supabase types yet - use type cast
  - Check `result.error` before accessing count for tables that might not exist
