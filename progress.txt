## Codebase Patterns
- Reading levels use 'simple', 'standard', 'advanced' keys (not child/teen/undergrad/postdoc)
- BriefSummaries interface and ReadingLevel type are exported from lib/supabase/client.ts
- Use type assertions (as any) for Supabase tables not fully typed in schema (e.g., saved_briefs)
- Missing lib modules (auth/providers, user/useUserDisplay, paywall/usePaywall, saved-briefs/useSavedBriefs) were created as stubs

- Updated brief summaries schema from 4 levels (child/teen/undergrad/postdoc) to 3 levels (simple/standard/advanced)
- Created BriefSummaries interface and ReadingLevel type in lib/supabase/client.ts
- Updated sample-briefs/what-is-a-state.json with new 3-level structure
- Updated sample-briefs/uk-four-day-week.json with new 3-level structure
- Updated app/brief/[id]/page.tsx reading level selector and default level
- Fixed multiple type errors in brief page (added explicit types to map callbacks)
- Created missing modules: lib/auth/providers.ts, lib/supabase/browser.ts, lib/user/useUserDisplay.ts, lib/paywall/usePaywall.ts, lib/saved-briefs/useSavedBriefs.ts
- Added saved_briefs table to Database type
- **Files changed:**
  - lib/supabase/client.ts
  - lib/supabase/browser.ts (new)
  - lib/auth/providers.ts (new)
  - lib/user/useUserDisplay.ts (new)
  - lib/paywall/usePaywall.ts (new)
  - lib/saved-briefs/useSavedBriefs.ts (new)
  - app/brief/[id]/page.tsx
  - sample-briefs/what-is-a-state.json
  - sample-briefs/uk-four-day-week.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Several auth/user modules were missing stubs - these need to be properly implemented later
  - When working on briefs, remember summaries use simple/standard/advanced keys
  - Supabase typed client requires table definitions in Database interface

- Created reusable ReadingLevelSelector component
- Component displays 3 pill buttons: Simple, Standard, Advanced
- Accepts level prop and onLevelChange callback
- Selected level uses filled styling, unselected uses outline
- Typecheck passes, verified in browser
- **Files changed:**
  - app/components/ReadingLevelSelector.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Brief page already has inline reading level selector - US-003 will replace it with this reusable component
  - Component uses ReadingLevel type from lib/supabase/client.ts for type safety

- Integrated ReadingLevelSelector component into brief page
- Added URL query param persistence using useSearchParams and useRouter
- Added localStorage persistence for return visits (key: soc_reading_level)
- URL syncs on initial load from localStorage if no URL param present
- Removed inline reading level selector code (replaced with component)
- **Files changed:**
  - app/brief/[id]/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use router.replace with { scroll: false } to update URL without page reload
  - localStorage key uses 'soc_' prefix for State of Clarity namespace
  - isValidReadingLevel type guard ensures type safety when reading from URL/localStorage
