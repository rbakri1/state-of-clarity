## Frontend Skills Reference
**IMPORTANT:** Follow these Claude skills for consistency:
- `.claude/skills/frontend-excellence.md` - Component architecture, Radix/shadcn patterns, accessibility
- `.claude/skills/brand-guidelines.md` - Colors, typography, component styling

## Codebase Patterns
- Use Radix UI components from `@radix-ui/react-*` for modals/dialogs
- Use Lucide React icons from `lucide-react`
- Use shadcn/ui components where available (`components/ui/`)
- Tailwind CSS with State of Clarity theme:
  - Primary: Sage (green) for actions
  - Backgrounds: Ivory (off-white)
  - Text: Ink (dark gray/black)
  - Warning: Yellow for ethics notices
- Next.js 14 App Router with `use client` for client components
- SSE via fetch with ReadableStream parsing (not EventSource for POST requests)
- Types from `@/lib/types/accountability`
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- forwardRef for composable components
- Handle all states: loading, error, empty, success

## Accessibility Requirements (from frontend-excellence.md)
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Visible focus indicators
- ARIA labels on icons and non-text elements
- Use Radix primitives for interactive elements (built-in a11y)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bbe2e-86e6-7214-838c-cd69f26d6d99
- US-001: Landing page already existed, verified complete
- US-002: Updated ethics modal with checkbox, 5 ethical principles, navigation to generate page
- US-003: Created useInvestigationGeneration SSE hook with agent status tracking
- US-004: Created generation progress page with 5 stages, progress bar, error handling
- Files changed: 
  - components/accountability/ethics-modal.tsx (updated)
  - lib/hooks/useInvestigationGeneration.ts (new)
  - app/accountability/generate/page.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Suspense wrapper for pages with useSearchParams
  - SSE parsing requires buffer handling for chunked responses
  - Follow patterns from existing components (brief-card.tsx) for styling consistency

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bbe4c-f08c-77f8-8055-033f51ca7066
- Created profile-section.tsx with expandable cards for UK public records
- Implemented DataCompletenessIndicator showing coverage for 5 data sources
- Each expandable card (ExpandableCard) supports expand/collapse with ChevronDown rotation
- Displays Companies House, Charity Commission, Register of Interests, Electoral Commission, Contracts Finder
- Empty state shows "No data found for this source" with AlertCircle icon
- Source URLs shown as external links
- Files changed:
  - components/accountability/profile-section.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use local useState for expand/collapse since no global state needed
  - Color-code data completeness percentage (green >70%, yellow 40-70%, red <40%)
  - Follow existing typing from lib/types/accountability.ts

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bbe50-0bd0-77f6-96ca-5834ce3fe6be
- Created scenarios-section.tsx with expandable ScenarioCards
- Risk level badges: color-coded (red=high/critical, yellow=medium, gray=low)
- Ethics reminder banner about hypothetical scenarios
- Each scenario shows: title, risk badge, description, enabling positions, red flags, innocent explanations (highlighted in green box), mechanism, detection difficulty
- Empty state with "No scenarios identified" message
- Files changed:
  - components/accountability/scenarios-section.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use getRiskBadgeStyles() pattern for consistent risk level coloring
  - Highlight innocent explanations prominently (green bg) to balance red flags
  - Follow CorruptionScenario type from lib/types/accountability.ts
