## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run build` to typecheck the project
- Vercel KV uses `kv` export from `/lib/cache/kv-client.ts` with automatic fallback to in-memory
- Cache key format convention: `{resource}:{id}` e.g., `brief:abc123`

- Installed @vercel/kv, tailwindcss-animate, @supabase/ssr packages
- Created /lib/cache/kv-client.ts with KVClient interface, VercelKVClient, and InMemoryKV fallback
- Added KV_REST_API_URL and KV_REST_API_TOKEN to .env.example
- Documented Vercel KV setup in SETUP.md (Step 5)
- Fixed pre-existing type errors in app/brief/[id]/page.tsx (implicit any types)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The npm install may remove existing packages; always run `npm install` after adding new packages
  - Main branch has some pre-existing type errors that need fixing
  - Use explicit type annotations in .map() callbacks when dealing with `any` typed objects

- Created /lib/cache/with-cache.ts with generic withCache<T> function
- Function checks cache first, executes fn on miss, stores result with TTL
- Logs cache hits/misses with [Cache] HIT/MISS prefix
- Handles cache read/write errors gracefully (logs and proceeds with direct fetch)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `withCache(key, fn, ttlSeconds)` pattern to wrap any async operation
  - Cache errors are logged but never block the main operation
