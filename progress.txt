## Codebase Patterns
- Services go in `/lib/services/` with JSDoc comments on all exported functions
- Use types from `/lib/types/accountability.ts` for accountability features
- Handle 404 responses gracefully by returning empty arrays (not throwing)
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s delays, 3 attempts)
- Use `verificationStatus: "verified"` for official API sources, `"unverified"` for web scraped data

- Created Companies House API service file at `/lib/services/companies-house-api.ts`
- Added COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY to .env.example
- Implemented:
  - `getCompaniesHouseAuthHeader()` - Basic Auth header generation
  - `searchOfficers(name)` - Search officers endpoint
  - `getOfficerAppointments(officerId)` - Get appointments for an officer
  - `fetchCompaniesHouseProfile(entityName)` - Full profile with retry logic
- All functions have JSDoc comments
- 404 responses return empty arrays (graceful handling)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pre-existing test errors in `__tests__/` directory - not blocking commits
  - Types `CompanyRecord` and `InvestigationSource` already defined in accountability.ts
  - Companies House API uses Basic Auth with API key as username and empty password
