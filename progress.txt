## Codebase Patterns
- Design system uses warm editorial palette (Sage/Ivory/Ink), NOT blue/slate
- Tailwind config now has full design tokens: use `bg-ivory-100`, `text-ink-800`, `bg-sage-500` etc.
- Font families: `font-heading` (Canela/serif), `font-body` (Source Serif 4), `font-ui` (Inter)
- Use `max-w-prose` for 65ch optimal reading width
- Political lean colors: `political-left`, `political-center`, `political-right` etc.
- Current implementation uses shadcn/ui CSS variables pattern (hsl(var(--primary)))
- Skills folder contains comprehensive design specs: skills/frontend/{design,brand,components,tech}
- Pages are in app/ directory using Next.js App Router
- cn() helper at @/lib/utils for conditional Tailwind classes (uses clsx + tailwind-merge)
- Brief types (ReadingLevel, PoliticalLean, Source, Brief, etc.) at @/lib/types/brief.ts
- Components go in components/{brief,sources,generation,layout,feedback}/ subdirectories
- Header/footer are duplicated inline in each page - need extraction
- 5 key components STILL MISSING: SourceCitation, SourceCard, BriefGenerationProgress, Header, Footer
- PoliticalLeanBadge now complete at @/components/sources/political-lean-badge.tsx with muted non-partisan colors
- CredibilityBadge now complete at @/components/sources/credibility-badge.tsx with tiered icons (ShieldCheck/Shield/ShieldAlert)
- ReadingLevelSelector now complete with ARIA roles, sticky positioning, warm palette
- SummaryCard now complete at @/components/brief/summary-card.tsx with typography per level and reading time

- **What was implemented:** Comprehensive UI audit against design system skills
- **Files created:** docs/UI-AUDIT.md
- **Files reviewed:** 
  - All 4 skill files (design, brand, components, tech)
  - tailwind.config.ts
  - app/globals.css
  - app/page.tsx (homepage)
  - app/layout.tsx
  - app/brief/[id]/page.tsx (brief viewer)
  - app/auth/signup/page.tsx
  - app/privacy/page.tsx
  - app/terms/page.tsx
  - components/cookie-consent-banner.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The design system specifies Deep Sage (#5E6F64) as primary, NOT blue
  - No pure white (#FFFFFF) or pure black (#000000) allowed - use Ivory/Ink
  - Typography should use serif for headings (Canela) and body (Source Serif 4)
  - Reading levels need specific typography: child=text-lg/leading-relaxed, teen/undergrad=text-base/leading-normal, postdoc=text-base/leading-snug
  - Political lean colors are for data viz only, NOT UI chrome
  - All focus states should use focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-sage-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2
  - 8 key components are completely missing (see audit doc)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019baf05-900a-749b-bcb9-2cc922a4d6b8
- **What was implemented:** Comprehensive component audit against skills/frontend/components/SKILL.md
- **Files changed:** docs/UI-AUDIT.md (expanded Section 6 with detailed component analysis)
- **Findings:**
  - 9 components are MISSING: ReadingLevelSelector, SummaryCard, SourceCitation, SourceCard, PoliticalLeanBadge, CredibilityBadge, BriefGenerationProgress, Header, Footer
  - 1 component exists but needs fixes: CookieConsentBanner (wrong colors, no focus rings)
  - Directory structure completely missing (no ui/, brief/, sources/, generation/, layout/, feedback/ folders)
  - Types defined inline in brief page rather than exported from lib/types/brief.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reading level selector is inline in app/brief/[id]/page.tsx around lines 296-341
  - Labels use "Post-doc" instead of "Postdoc" and "Graduate" instead of "Graduate+"
  - Political lean colors use partisan red/blue instead of muted rose/blue spectrum
  - No ARIA roles, no sticky positioning on reading level selector
  - No credibility scores displayed for sources
  - No generation progress UI exists (users wait 30-60s with no feedback)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019baf08-5056-7472-a711-caf108566707

  - ReadingLevel and other brief types exported from @/lib/types/brief
  - Component uses warm editorial palette: bg-ivory-100, bg-sage-500, text-ink-600
  - ARIA pattern: role="tablist" on container, role="tab" + aria-selected on buttons, aria-controls/labelledby for panels
  - Focus states: focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-sage-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2
  - Responsive: flex-col on mobile, flex-row on desktop (sm:flex-row)
  - Minimum touch target: min-h-[48px] min-w-[48px] for accessibility

- **What was implemented:** SummaryCard component with progressive typography per reading level
- **Files created:**
  - components/brief/summary-card.tsx (main component)
- **Files changed:**
  - app/brief/[id]/page.tsx (integrated SummaryCard component, removed inline implementation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SummaryCard now available at @/components/brief/summary-card for displaying summaries with proper typography
  - Typography per level: child=text-lg/leading-relaxed, teen/undergrad=text-base/leading-normal, postdoc=text-base/leading-snug
  - Reading time calculated automatically from content word count (200 wpm)
  - ARIA pattern: role="tabpanel" + hidden attribute for inactive panels, aria-labelledby for tab association
  - Brief data uses Record<ReadingLevel, string> format, not array of ReadingLevelSummary objects
  - Each level renders as separate tabpanel div with only the active one visible

- **What was implemented:** PoliticalLeanBadge component for displaying source political lean
- **Files created:**
  - components/sources/political-lean-badge.tsx (main component)
- **Features:**
  - Uses muted non-partisan rose→grey→blue spectrum per design spec
  - Left: muted rose #8B4840 on #F5EBE9
  - Center-Left: #9A6F6F on #F5ECEC
  - Center: ink-600 on ivory-200
  - Center-Right: #4D6672 on #EBF1F4

  - Components in sources/ directory should import from @/components/sources/{component-name}
  - Political lean colors are non-partisan - avoid UK flag red/blue associations
  - Use subtle background colors for readability on badges
