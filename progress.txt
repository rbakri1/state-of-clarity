## Codebase Patterns
- Pre-existing typecheck errors in `app/brief/[id]/page.tsx` and `lib/supabase/client.ts` - these are unrelated to new changes
- Agents live in `/lib/agents/` directory
- Types should be organized in `/lib/types/` directory

- Created `/lib/types/classification.ts` with all classification taxonomy types
- Files changed: lib/types/classification.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Types directory created at `/lib/types/` for shared type definitions
  - Classification types: Domain (11 values), ControversyLevel (3), QuestionType (4), TemporalScope (4)
