## Codebase Patterns
- Reading levels use 'simple', 'standard', 'advanced' keys (not child/teen/undergrad/postdoc)
- BriefSummaries interface and ReadingLevel type are exported from lib/supabase/client.ts
- Use type assertions (as any) for Supabase tables not fully typed in schema (e.g., saved_briefs)
- Missing lib modules (auth/providers, user/useUserDisplay, paywall/usePaywall, saved-briefs/useSavedBriefs) were created as stubs

- Updated brief summaries schema from 4 levels (child/teen/undergrad/postdoc) to 3 levels (simple/standard/advanced)
- Created BriefSummaries interface and ReadingLevel type in lib/supabase/client.ts
- Updated sample-briefs/what-is-a-state.json with new 3-level structure
- Updated sample-briefs/uk-four-day-week.json with new 3-level structure
- Updated app/brief/[id]/page.tsx reading level selector and default level
- Fixed multiple type errors in brief page (added explicit types to map callbacks)
- Created missing modules: lib/auth/providers.ts, lib/supabase/browser.ts, lib/user/useUserDisplay.ts, lib/paywall/usePaywall.ts, lib/saved-briefs/useSavedBriefs.ts
- Added saved_briefs table to Database type
- **Files changed:**
  - lib/supabase/client.ts
  - lib/supabase/browser.ts (new)
  - lib/auth/providers.ts (new)
  - lib/user/useUserDisplay.ts (new)
  - lib/paywall/usePaywall.ts (new)
  - lib/saved-briefs/useSavedBriefs.ts (new)
  - app/brief/[id]/page.tsx
  - sample-briefs/what-is-a-state.json
  - sample-briefs/uk-four-day-week.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Several auth/user modules were missing stubs - these need to be properly implemented later
  - When working on briefs, remember summaries use simple/standard/advanced keys
  - Supabase typed client requires table definitions in Database interface
