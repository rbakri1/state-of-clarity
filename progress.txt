## Codebase Patterns
- Use `withAuth` from `@/lib/auth/middleware` for authenticated API routes
- Use `withRateLimit` from `@/lib/auth/middleware` for rate-limited endpoints
- SSE helpers are in `lib/api/sse-helpers.ts` - use `createSSEResponse` and `sendSSE`
- Credit service functions: `hasCredits`, `deductCredits`, `refundCredits` from `lib/services/credit-service.ts`
- Accountability service functions: `createInvestigation`, `getInvestigation`, `listUserInvestigations`, `getInvestigationSources` from `lib/services/accountability-service.ts`

- Created SSE helper functions in lib/api/sse-helpers.ts
- Exported `createSSEResponse()` with proper SSE headers
- Exported `sendSSE()` that formats events as SSE spec
- Files changed: lib/api/sse-helpers.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TextEncoder should be created once at module level for efficiency
  - SSE format: `event: {name}\ndata: {json}\n\n` with double newline at end

- Created list investigations endpoint at /app/api/accountability/route.ts
- GET method uses withAuth middleware
- Returns { investigations: AccountabilityInvestigation[] }
- Files changed: app/api/accountability/route.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `listUserInvestigations` already handles ordering by created_at DESC and returns empty array
  - Keep API routes minimal - the service layer handles the logic

- Created fetch investigation endpoint at /app/api/accountability/[id]/route.ts
- GET method with withAuth middleware
- Returns 404 if not found, 403 if not owner
- Includes sources from getInvestigationSources
- Files changed: app/api/accountability/[id]/route.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js 15 params are Promises - use `await params` then access the id
  - Match the existing withAuth signature: `async (_req, { user, params })` with optional typing
