## Codebase Patterns
- Design system uses warm editorial palette (Sage/Ivory/Ink), NOT blue/slate
- Current implementation uses shadcn/ui CSS variables pattern (hsl(var(--primary)))
- Skills folder contains comprehensive design specs: skills/frontend/{design,brand,components,tech}
- Pages are in app/ directory using Next.js App Router
- Only one component exists: components/cookie-consent-banner.tsx
- Header/footer are duplicated inline in each page - need extraction

- **What was implemented:** Comprehensive UI audit against design system skills
- **Files created:** docs/UI-AUDIT.md
- **Files reviewed:** 
  - All 4 skill files (design, brand, components, tech)
  - tailwind.config.ts
  - app/globals.css
  - app/page.tsx (homepage)
  - app/layout.tsx
  - app/brief/[id]/page.tsx (brief viewer)
  - app/auth/signup/page.tsx
  - app/privacy/page.tsx
  - app/terms/page.tsx
  - components/cookie-consent-banner.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The design system specifies Deep Sage (#5E6F64) as primary, NOT blue
  - No pure white (#FFFFFF) or pure black (#000000) allowed - use Ivory/Ink
  - Typography should use serif for headings (Canela) and body (Source Serif 4)
  - Reading levels need specific typography: child=text-lg/leading-relaxed, teen/undergrad=text-base/leading-normal, postdoc=text-base/leading-snug
  - Political lean colors are for data viz only, NOT UI chrome
  - All focus states should use focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-sage-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2
  - 8 key components are completely missing (see audit doc)
