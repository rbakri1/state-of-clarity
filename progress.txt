## Codebase Patterns
- Use lucide-react for icons (AlertTriangle, ChevronDown, ChevronUp, RefreshCw)
- Error components use red-50/red-950 bg with red-200/red-800 borders for dark mode support
- Use "use client" directive for components with useState or interactivity
- No cn utility - use template literals for className concatenation: `${base} ${custom}`
- Use Tailwind animate-pulse for skeleton/loading states
- Use `safeQuery` from lib/supabase/safe-query.ts for Supabase queries with error handling
- Supabase query functions use PromiseLike (not Promise) for type compatibility with PostgrestBuilder
- Use `safeAICall` from lib/ai/safe-ai-call.ts for AI API calls with retry logic (3 attempts) and Sentry logging
- Use `safeStripeCall` from lib/stripe/safe-stripe-call.ts for Stripe API calls with Sentry logging and user-friendly errors

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad40-e1da-729c-9c27-b468fd383615
- Implemented ErrorMessage component at /app/components/ErrorMessage.tsx
- Props: title, message, details (optional), onRetry (optional)
- Friendly AlertTriangle icon, collapsible technical details section
- "Try again" button only shows when onRetry callback provided
- Files changed: app/components/ErrorMessage.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow existing ErrorBoundary styling patterns for consistency
  - Use collapsible details pattern with useState for show/hide toggle

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad42-e43c-7506-81e2-a86d988af9fb
- Created error message mapping at /lib/errors/error-messages.ts
- Maps all error codes from api-error.ts plus NETWORK_ERROR and UNKNOWN fallback
- FriendlyError interface with title and message fields
- Two helper functions: getFriendlyError(code) and getErrorByStatusCode(statusCode)
- Files changed: lib/errors/error-messages.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reuse ErrorCodes from api-error.ts for type safety
  - Include UNKNOWN as default fallback for any unmapped error codes

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad44-b2ad-7018-889b-a26a076e8ec9
- Created Skeleton component at /app/components/Skeleton.tsx
- Variants: text, paragraph, card, avatar, button
- Uses Tailwind animate-pulse for subtle loading animation
- Accepts className prop for custom sizing
- Uses aria-hidden="true" for accessibility
- Files changed: app/components/Skeleton.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Codebase doesn't have a cn utility - use template literals for class concatenation
  - Tailwind's animate-pulse works well for skeleton loading states
  - Use gray-200/gray-700 for light/dark mode skeleton backgrounds

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad48-5423-748c-98b5-e20682f37d5c
- Created loading skeleton for brief page at /app/brief/[id]/loading.tsx
- Skeletons for: header (title, clarity score, tags), reading level selector, summary, structured data sections, narrative, sources grid, feedback section
- Matches BriefPageClient.tsx layout structure exactly
- Uses existing Skeleton component with variants: text, paragraph, card, button
- Files changed: app/brief/[id]/loading.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js app router loading.tsx files are automatically used during Suspense boundaries
  - Match skeleton layout closely to actual page to minimize layout shift
  - Use Skeleton variant="card" for grid items like sources

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad4d-f67c-7471-bc50-ba184c54dea2
- Created homepage loading skeleton at /app/loading.tsx
- Skeletons for: header, hero section, search input, 3 feature cards, 3 showcase brief cards, footer
- Matches page.tsx layout structure exactly
- Uses existing Skeleton component with appropriate variants and sizing
- Files changed: app/loading.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Homepage has 5 main sections: header, hero, features grid, showcase briefs grid, footer
  - Use Array.from({ length: N }) for generating repeated skeleton elements in grids
  - Match skeleton dimensions to actual content (e.g., h-12 for titles, h-6 for subtitles)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad51-20fb-7411-8faf-b0708ffd286a
- Created safeQuery utility at /lib/supabase/safe-query.ts
- Wraps Supabase queries with try-catch, logs to Sentry with query context
- Returns SafeQueryResult with data, error, and isConnectionError flag
- Detects connection errors by error codes and message keywords
- Updated getBriefById in brief-service.ts to use safeQuery
- Updated profile API route to use safeQuery for all database queries
- Files changed: lib/supabase/safe-query.ts, lib/services/brief-service.ts, app/api/profile/route.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use PromiseLike instead of Promise for Supabase query function types (PostgrestBuilder compatibility)
  - SafeQueryResult.isConnectionError distinguishes database-down from other errors
  - Sentry.captureException with tags and extra context for better error tracking

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bad55-192a-71cd-a80c-996da067e0e7
- Created safeAICall utility at /lib/ai/safe-ai-call.ts
- Wraps AI API calls with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff with jitter)
- Logs to Sentry with sanitized prompt context (truncated, email/phone redacted)
- Returns SafeAICallResult with data, error, and isAIServiceError flag
- Updated questions/suggest route to use safeAICall - falls back to template-only on AI failure
- Updated research-agent.ts: wrapped Tavily search and political lean classification
- Updated brief generation route to show friendly AI error messages
- Added AI_SERVICE_ERROR to error-messages.ts
- Files changed: lib/ai/safe-ai-call.ts, app/api/questions/suggest/route.ts, lib/agents/research-agent.ts, app/api/briefs/generate/route.ts, lib/errors/error-messages.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow safeQuery pattern for AI calls - same structure, different error detection
  - Sanitize prompts before logging: truncate, redact emails/phones
  - For suggestions: silent fallback to template-only results (return empty array)
  - For brief generation: propagate error with user-friendly message

- Created safeStripeCall utility at /lib/stripe/safe-stripe-call.ts
- Wraps Stripe API calls with try-catch, logs to Sentry, returns user-friendly errors
- Detects Stripe service errors (connection, rate limit, API errors)
- Never exposes raw Stripe errors to users - sanitizes all error messages
- Added checkStripeHealth() function for health checks
- Created /app/api/payments/health/route.ts with 30-second cache
- Updated create-checkout route to use safeStripeCall
- Updated credits page to check payment service health on load
- Disabled buy buttons when payment service unavailable (shows "Unavailable")
- Added yellow warning banner when payment service is down
- Added PAYMENT_SERVICE_ERROR to error-messages.ts
- Updated payment-retry-service.ts to use safeStripeCall
- Updated webhook route with Sentry logging
- Files changed: lib/stripe/safe-stripe-call.ts, app/api/payments/health/route.ts, app/api/payments/create-checkout/route.ts, app/credits/page.tsx, lib/errors/error-messages.ts, lib/services/payment-retry-service.ts, app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow safeQuery/safeAICall pattern for safeStripeCall - consistent error handling structure
  - Use checkStripeHealth() with stripe.balance.retrieve() as lightweight health check
  - Never expose raw Stripe errors - always sanitize with user-friendly messages
  - Add health check endpoint for UI to disable features when service is unavailable

- Created service health check endpoint at /app/api/health/route.ts
- Checks Supabase connection using lightweight query (briefs table)
- Returns { status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy', services: { supabase } }
- Includes latency measurement and error details
- 30-second cache to prevent excessive checks
- Detects connection errors vs other failures for degraded state
- Files changed: app/api/health/route.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow payments/health endpoint pattern for caching
  - Use lightweight queries (select id limit 1) for connection checks
  - Consider latency > 5s as "degraded" not "unhealthy"
