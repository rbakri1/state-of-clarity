## Codebase Patterns
- Migrations in `lib/supabase/migrations/` use pattern `NNN_description.sql` with `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses
- TypeScript types for briefs are in both `lib/types/brief.ts` (Brief interface) and `lib/services/brief-service.ts` (BriefRecord interface) - update both
- Main schema in `lib/supabase/schema.sql` should be updated alongside migrations for documentation
- Pre-existing test errors in `__tests__/` are not blocking - check typecheck passes on prod code
- `Brief.clarity_score` can be number OR ClarityScore object - always check typeof before using
- `Brief.summaries` can be array (ReadingLevelSummary[]) or Record<ReadingLevel, string> - handle both formats
- Tags are in `metadata.tags` as string array, use `.slice(0, N)` to limit display count

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb303-a4c0-74be-b2c9-1dfd678d6410
- Added `view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0` column to briefs table
- Created migration: `lib/supabase/migrations/011_add_view_count_column.sql`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types/brief.ts` and `lib/services/brief-service.ts`
- Updated main schema `lib/supabase/schema.sql` with column and index
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sample briefs already have `view_count` in fixtures - they expected this column
  - The `BriefRecord` type (service layer) and `Brief` type (frontend) are separate
  - Pre-existing test errors are unrelated to new changes

- Added `is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT true` column to briefs table
- Created migration: `lib/supabase/migrations/012_add_is_public_column.sql`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types/brief.ts` and `lib/services/brief-service.ts`
- Updated main schema `lib/supabase/schema.sql` with column and partial index
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Used partial index `WHERE is_public = true` for efficient Explore page filtering
  - Follow same pattern as US-001 for adding columns

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb30b-5ba3-775f-a3ad-93ceceb6032c
- Created `/api/briefs/[id]/view/route.ts` endpoint to increment view_count
- Uses httpOnly cookie (`brief_viewed_{id}`) with 24hr expiry to track session views
- Updated `app/brief/[id]/page.tsx` to call view tracking after successful brief load
- View tracking fails silently (console.warn only) to not break page load
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `cookies()` from `next/headers` for cookie access in route handlers
  - Supabase client pattern: `getSupabaseClient()` function with service role key
  - Keep view tracking non-blocking with silent failures

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb30e-e822-71c1-ae8c-f8b2aee8375b
- Created `/api/briefs/route.ts` GET endpoint for Explore page
- Added `exploreBriefsQuerySchema` to `lib/validation/brief-schemas.ts` for param validation
- Supports: search (q), tags, minScore, sort (newest/oldest/score/views), date filter, pagination
- Uses Supabase `.overlaps()` for tag filtering on `metadata->tags` JSONB array
- Returns `{ briefs, total, hasMore }` with 60s cache
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tags are stored in `metadata.tags` as JSONB array, use `.overlaps()` for array filtering
  - Use `{ count: "exact" }` in select to get total for pagination
  - Pattern: Create zod schema in validation file, use in route handler

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb312-8634-75bf-a0fe-46a6cae9e1bf
- Created `/app/explore/page.tsx` with hero section for Explore Briefs
- Hero includes: Compass icon badge, "Explore Briefs" heading, discovery subtitle
- Uses design system: ivory-100 bg, ink-800 text, sage-100/600 for badge, font-heading/font-body
- Server component with metadata for SEO (title, description)
- Placeholder content section for upcoming grid/filters stories
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Server components don't need "use client" and can export metadata directly
  - Dev browser may need network idle wait for full CSS hydration
  - Follow existing page patterns from homepage for consistent styling

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb317-67e2-727f-9bba-42948faa9ebf
- Created `components/explore/brief-card.tsx` component for Explore page grid
- Card displays: question title, clarity score badge (color-coded), tags (max 3), reading time, 2-line excerpt
- Uses absolute positioned link overlay for card navigation with z-index for clickable tags
- Tags are buttons with `onTagClick` callback for filter integration in later stories
- Followed homepage showcase card styling patterns for consistency
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Brief.clarity_score` can be number OR ClarityScore object - need to handle both cases
  - Tags are in `metadata.tags` as string array
  - Summaries can be array (ReadingLevelSummary[]) or Record<ReadingLevel, string> - handle both
  - Use `line-clamp-2` for 2-line truncation CSS

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb351-1cd4-7516-a9eb-5f57cef07047
- Implementation already complete (commit 0cfecc1) - updating PRD to mark as passing
- BriefsGrid component in `components/explore/briefs-grid.tsx`:
  - Fetches from /api/briefs on page load with useEffect
  - Responsive grid: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
  - Shows 6 skeleton loaders while fetching
  - EmptyState component when no briefs
  - "Showing X of Y briefs" count display
  - Error state with red background on API failure
- Browser verification: Grid and skeleton loaders render correctly
- Pre-existing JS error ("Invalid or unexpected token") affects all pages, not specific to this implementation
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BriefsGrid uses BriefsResponse interface: { briefs: Brief[], total: number, hasMore: boolean }
  - Skeleton loaders use animate-pulse class for loading animation
  - onTagClick callback placeholder for future tag filter integration (US-009)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb358-a776-737c-825e-a0ae55732c50
- Created `components/explore/search-input.tsx` with debounced search (300ms)
- Created `components/explore/explore-content.tsx` to manage URL state and grid
- Updated `app/explore/page.tsx` to use ExploreContent with Suspense boundary
- Search persists in URL via `?q=searchterm` using useSearchParams/useRouter
- Clear button (X) resets search, empty state shows "No matching briefs" message
- Results count shows "for [query]" when filtering
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Always wrap useSearchParams in Suspense boundary for Next.js SSG compatibility
  - Debounce pattern: track localValue in state, sync with prop, useEffect with setTimeout
  - ExploreContent replaces BriefsGrid with integrated search functionality
