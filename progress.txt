## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run build` to typecheck the project
- Vercel KV uses `kv` export from `/lib/cache/kv-client.ts` with automatic fallback to in-memory
- Cache key format convention: `{resource}:{id}` e.g., `brief:abc123`

- Installed @vercel/kv, tailwindcss-animate, @supabase/ssr packages
- Created /lib/cache/kv-client.ts with KVClient interface, VercelKVClient, and InMemoryKV fallback
- Added KV_REST_API_URL and KV_REST_API_TOKEN to .env.example
- Documented Vercel KV setup in SETUP.md (Step 5)
- Fixed pre-existing type errors in app/brief/[id]/page.tsx (implicit any types)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The npm install may remove existing packages; always run `npm install` after adding new packages
  - Main branch has some pre-existing type errors that need fixing
  - Use explicit type annotations in .map() callbacks when dealing with `any` typed objects

- Created /lib/cache/with-cache.ts with generic withCache<T> function
- Function checks cache first, executes fn on miss, stores result with TTL
- Logs cache hits/misses with [Cache] HIT/MISS prefix
- Handles cache read/write errors gracefully (logs and proceeds with direct fetch)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `withCache(key, fn, ttlSeconds)` pattern to wrap any async operation
  - Cache errors are logged but never block the main operation

- Created /lib/cache/invalidate.ts with invalidateCache and invalidatePattern functions
- invalidateCache(key) deletes a single key and logs the event
- invalidatePattern(pattern) finds keys matching pattern and deletes them all
- All errors are caught and logged, never thrown (consistent with with-cache.ts)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `invalidateCache('brief:${id}')` to clear a specific brief cache
  - Use `invalidatePattern('brief:*')` to clear all brief caches

- Created /lib/services/brief-service.ts with getBriefById function
- Uses withCache wrapper with key format `brief:{id}` and 300 second TTL
- Fetches from Supabase using createServiceRoleClient
- Returns null for not found (PGRST116 error), throws for other errors
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - lib/services directory did not exist; created it for this story
  - Use `createServiceRoleClient()` for server-side data fetching that bypasses RLS
  - PGRST116 is the Supabase error code for "no rows found"
