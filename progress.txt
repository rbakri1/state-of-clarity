## Codebase Patterns
- Use Claude Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) for cheaper classification/scoring tasks
- Types live in /lib/types/, agents in /lib/agents/
- Follow existing code style: JSDoc comments at top, interfaces defined before use, utility functions at bottom

- Created /lib/types/clarity-scoring.ts with all 7 scoring dimensions
- Defined types: DimensionName, ScoringDimension, DimensionScore, EvaluatorVerdict, Issue, ClarityScore, DisagreementResult, PrioritizedIssue
- Weights sum to 1.0: firstPrinciplesCoherence (0.20), evidenceQuality (0.20), internalConsistency (0.15), accessibility (0.15), factualAccuracy (0.15), objectivity (0.10), biasDetection (0.05)
- Added utility functions: getDimensionWeight, getAllDimensions, validateWeightsSum
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pre-existing type errors exist in app/brief/[id]/page.tsx - don't block on those
  - Dimension scoring guidelines follow 10/8-9/6-7/4-5/1-3 band structure
