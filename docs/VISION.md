# State of Clarity - Vision & Origin

## How I Got Into Politics

2024 was the year I started thinking more about politics. I started to stress much more about the direction the country was moving in, what I felt was the drastic decline in western culture and values and what kind of future was in store for my children should we stay in the UK. And most of all, what little was being done by the political class to address this…

As a technologist and entrepreneur, I've spent my career focused on building, executing, and solving problems. Politics felt like the opposite: a space of endless talk, little execution, and even less accountability.

In 2024, something shifted amongst the technology and entrepreneurial class.

The people who build, innovate, and take risks started speaking out. Figures like David Sacks, Peter Thiel and especially Elon Musk inspired me. Sacks, once a lone voice for Republican technologists, used the All-In podcast to challenge the status quo, while Musk took unprecedented risks to engage politically. These weren't just symbolic gestures; they were actions rooted in the belief that entrepreneurs have a role to play in repairing what's broken in the West. Whether you like or agree with these figures is not the point; their *action* and ownership is the key point here.

This resonated deeply with me. For too long, the political class has been dominated by lifelong politicians who, with respect, often lack the executional track record you find in private industry. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are used to delivering results—quickly and effectively—because their survival depends on it. The contrast couldn't be clearer and they aren't marginal; they are orders of magnitude.

As I've gotten older, I've also seen successive governments fail to deliver on their promises. Having built teams and companies myself, I've come to appreciate what exceptional execution looks like. Bureaucracy, as every entrepreneur knows, kills it. That disconnect between what Governments promise and what they deliver feels more stark when you're used to moving fast and making things happen.

Another major influence in 2024 has been Dominic Cummings. Like him or loathe him, Cummings is one of the sharpest minds in British politics. His accounts of waste, bungled execution, and lack of ownership in government are horrifying. But they're also entirely believable. His stories paint a picture of an administrative state that is performative rather than practical, which is deeply frustrating given the stakes. And his predictions keep coming true. He has even been begrudgingly vindicated by this Labour Government.

And the stakes are high. I'm genuinely concerned about the future of the UK and Western Europe. Social cohesion is fraying. Overregulation is stifling growth. Poor decision-making over decades has left us vulnerable. Many of these decisions, though well-intentioned, lacked foresight and second-order thinking. It's no longer enough to point fingers. If we're going to solve these issues, we need action, not platitudes.

This year, I've been wrestling with how to channel my frustration productively. I've spent a lot of time reading, learning, and reflecting—and, admittedly, venting with mates down the pub. But that's not enough. If we're serious about fixing what's broken, the entrepreneurial class has to step up and engage in a meaningful way. Unless a billionaire, we also need to realise that we aren't the main character, but we can be still play our part.

**State of Clarity** is my initial idea on how to do something that I think would be value-add and interesting. One thing is clear to me: the spirit of innovation, execution, and accountability that drives startups needs to find its way into politics. It's time for the builders to become political leaders.

**Reminder to all my friends in entrepreneurship and technology** - just like with building companies - we do not need permission from anyone to start dabbling in politics. We've just got to figure out what role we want to play and then put in a little graft. 2026 is the year I'll start to play mine.

## Why This Project Matters

I am starting this project for two key reasons: to **become one of the most informed people on any topic I explore** and to **elevate the quality of debate in the UK and beyond**. But there's more to it than that. Here's why this work is relevant and essential:

### 1. Reclaiming Deep Thinking

Modern discourse, be it podcasts, news or even I'm afraid to say broadsheets, is dominated by soundbites and surface-level takes. I want to play a small part in bringing back **intellectual curiosity**—to push beyond confirmation bias and create a space where **understanding comes before arguing**.

### 2. Restoring Civil Discourse

Debate today is often about **winning, not learning**. This project is about **productive disagreement**, helping people engage thoughtfully and **bridge divides rather than deepen them**.

### 3. Building a Framework for Better Thinking

This isn't just about gathering knowledge—it's about creating a **mental system for thinking, analysing, and deciding at the highest level**. A clear-thinking process helps cut through misinformation and make smarter choices.

### 4. Competing with Noise

The loudest voices are often not the wisest. Social media rewards outrage, not depth. This project is a **counterbalance to the noise**, where **rigor and reason outperform speed and sensationalism**. But we are not naive to the fact we must stand out and move fast; we have some ideas on how to do this.

### 5. Future-Proofing Decision-Making

Seeing reality clearly is a **superpower** in business, politics, and life. This project aims to sharpen the ability to **assess information, think in first principles, and make independent, high-quality judgments**.

### 6. Making Complexity Simple and Actionable

Hard problems require clear thinking. The goal isn't just to **understand**, but to **explain, apply, and help others make better choices**.

This project is about **breaking through the fog, embracing intellectual challenge, and shaping better conversations**. It's about clarity, depth, and the ultimately pursuit of truth.

## Core Principles

### 1. Truth-Seeking Over Partisanship
**Core Principle:** The ultimate aim is uncovering the truth, avoiding cherry-picking data or succumbing to ideological biases. This ensures credibility and intellectual rigour and provides a logical base that means solutions put forward may actually work.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Build frameworks to evaluate all sources critically.
- Collaborate with cross-ideological experts to challenge assumptions.
- Acknowledge our political tilt and the why behind it.
- Do not 'both sides' each debate; sometimes our conclusion will simply be a particular view is very *obviously* correct. We will not shy away from wherever our reason takes us.

### 2. Efficiency Through the 80-20 Rule
**Core Principle:** Maximize impact with minimal time investment by leveraging cutting-edge tools and focused efforts.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Deploy AI-driven tools like LLMs and data visualisation software.
- Assemble a cross-functional support team of junior researchers and AI assistants. Build agentic AI systems once the human led systems are beta tested.
- Prioritise quick wins and high-value outputs within each topic.

### 3. Iterative, Open-Sourced Thinking
**Core Principle:** Embrace a rapid, iterative approach that prioritises initial publication and incorporates post-publication feedback and crowd-sourced insights.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Publish "living documents" with a clear disclaimer on iterative development.
- Actively solicit feedback from the public, experts, and critics.

### 4. Decision-Oriented Analysis
**Core Principle:** Every exploration should result in actionable suggestions or evaluations of existing policies.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Use scenario planning to present potential decisions and their implications.
- Evaluate policies by their incentives, impact, and likely areas of grift or corruption.

### 5. Novel, User-Centric Artefacts
**Core Principle:** Create dynamic, interactive artefacts for each topic, adhering to progressive disclosure to cater to diverse audiences.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Use web pages as hubs with modular content: summaries, detailed analyses, videos, podcasts, and infographics.
- Tailor content to varying depths of understanding, from "explain it to a five-year-old" through to "phd-level" discussions.

### 6. Multi-Factor Exploration
**Core Principle:** Break away from oversimplified debates by examining the full breadth of factors impacting a topic, their relationships and importance.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Develop a standardised method for assessing and ranking factors.
- Create metadata for each factor, such as its scale of influence, interdependencies, and variability.

### 7. Principles and Prioritisation
**Core Principle:** Define and force-rank principles for each topic to establish clear priorities and encourage meaningful discourse.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Clearly articulate principles guiding your analysis.
- Justify the ranking of these principles and revisit them based on new insights.

### 8. Investigative Journalism
**Core Principle:** Uncover and highlight underlying incentives and possible grift behind decisions, policies, or industry practices in a way that doesn't take months or years. We are looking for quicker wins.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Develop a methodology for assessing incentives.
- Incorporate historical or contemporary examples of grift into analyses.

## The Entrepreneurial Approach to Politics

The contrast between how entrepreneurs and politicians operate is stark:

| **Entrepreneurs** | **Politicians** |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Move fast, iterate, ship | Endless committees, slow decisions |
| Accountable to customers/investors | Limited accountability to voters |
| Survival depends on execution | Survival depends on rhetoric |
| Focus on outcomes | Focus on optics |
| Adapt or die | Entrenched bureaucracy |

State of Clarity brings the entrepreneurial mindset to political analysis:
- **Speed**: Publish fast, iterate based on feedback
- **Transparency**: Open-source our thinking, sources, and methods
- **Accountability**: Track impact metrics, measure quality rigorously
- **Execution**: Deliver decision-ready insights, not just commentary

---

## The Path Forward

This isn't about replacing politicians or experts. It's about:

1. **Upgrading the tools** available to citizens, journalists, and policymakers
2. **Demonstrating** that rigorous, non-partisan analysis is possible at scale
3. **Building infrastructure** for better political discourse
4. **Empowering** the entrepreneurial class to engage meaningfully in politics

The builders don't need permission to start. We just need to figure out our role and put in the work.

**2026 is the year we play our part.**
