# State of Clarity - Article Structure Template

This document defines the standard structure for State of Clarity briefs, ensuring consistency, depth, and actionability across all topics.

---

## Complete Article Structure

### 1. POSIT Hypothesis
**Purpose:** Anchor the exploration with a clear and concise statement.

**Content:**
- The hypothesis or question being addressed (e.g., "Are H1B visas fulfilling their intended purpose?")
- Brief explanation of its relevance
- Why this question matters now

**Example:**
```markdown
## POSIT

**Question:** What would be the economic and social impacts of implementing a mandatory 4-day work week in the UK?

**Relevance:** As worker burnout reaches historic highs and productivity debates intensify, several UK companies have trialed reduced-hour work weeks. This brief examines whether mandating this shift would benefit or harm the UK economy and workforce.
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Summaries
**Purpose:** Make the content accessible to different audiences.

**Content:**
Summaries tailored for:
- **Five-Year-Old Level** (Reading age 5-7)
- **Primary School Level** (Reading age 8-12)
- **A-Level/Undergraduate Level** (Reading age 18-22)
- **Postdoc Level** (Graduate level)

**Guidelines:**
- Each summary should be self-contained
- Maintain accuracy while adjusting complexity
- Use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure for each level
- Include analogies and examples suitable for the audience

---

### 3. Definitions Table
**Purpose:** Establish a shared understanding of key terms and concepts.

**Structure:**

| Key Term/Concept | Definition | Source/Citation | Points of Contention |
|------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 4-Day Work Week | A work arrangement where employees complete their full-time hours across four days instead of five... | OECD Employment Report, 2024 | Debate over whether this means compressed hours (4×10hr) or reduced hours (32hr week) |

**Guidelines:**
- Define terms before first use in the main text
- Include contested definitions where applicable
- Cite authoritative sources
- Flag where experts disagree on terminology

---

### 4. Historical Summary
**Purpose:** Provide context and trace the evolution of the topic.

**Structure:**

1. **Introduction:** Briefly explain why understanding the history is essential
2. **Origins and Early Development:** Foundations and early theories or policies
3. **Key Milestones:** Chronological highlights and their impacts
4. **Modern Context:** Recent trends and their implications
5. **Lessons from the Past:** Insights or recurring patterns relevant to the current discussion
6. **Visual Aids:** Timelines, charts, or infographics for clarity

**Note:** Necessity of specific elements are contextual to the questions we choose to answer.

---

### 5. Foundational Principles (If Applicable)
**Purpose:** Define and prioritise principles shaping the analysis.

**When to Use:**
- Foundational topics (e.g., "What is the role of the state?")
- Value-laden questions (e.g., "Should we prioritize growth or equality?")

**Structure:**

```markdown
## Foundational Principles

These principles guide our analysis, force-ranked by importance:

1. **Individual Liberty** (Highest Priority)
   - Definition: The freedom of individuals to make choices without coercion
   - Justification: Foundational to Western democracy and human rights

2. **Economic Prosperity**
   - Definition: Maximizing overall wealth and opportunity
   - Justification: Enables funding of public goods and social programs

3. **Social Cohesion**
   - Definition: Shared identity and mutual trust within society
   - Justification: Necessary for democratic legitimacy and collective action

**Why This Ranking?**
We prioritize liberty because without it, prosperity and cohesion become tools of oppression. However, we acknowledge this ranking is contestable and welcome debate.
```

### 6. Factors Table
**Purpose:** Capture the breadth of influences on the POSIT.

**Structure:**

| Factor Title | Description | Importance (1-10) | Evidence/Examples | Interdependencies | Uncertainty Level |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Worker Well-being | Mental health, burnout levels, work-life balance | 9 | UK pilot study: 71% reduction in anxiety | Linked to productivity, healthcare costs | Low - strong empirical evidence |
| Productivity | Output per hour worked | 10 | Mixed: +40% in Microsoft Japan trial, -15% in manufacturing | Depends on sector, management practices | Medium - varies by industry |

**Guidelines:**
- Importance Score: 1 (marginal) to 10 (critical)
- Uncertainty Level: Low/Medium/High based on evidence quality
- Interdependencies: Note causal relationships with other factors
- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)

---

### 7. Resources Table
**Purpose:** Ensure transparency and depth in sourcing.

**Structure:**

| Title | Description | Type | Link | Trust Score | Data Quality | Bias Assessment | Key Takeaways |

| The results of the world's largest four-day week trial | Report on UK pilot program (61 companies, 2,900 workers) | Primary Research | [Link](https://autonomy.work/portfolio/uk4dwt/) | 8.5/10 | High - Direct survey data | Center-left (Autonomy Institute) | 92% of companies continued policy; 71% reduction in burnout |

**Trust Score Criteria:**
- **9-10**: Peer-reviewed research, government statistics
- **7-8**: Reputable think tanks, established journalism
- **5-6**: Industry reports, advocacy groups
- **3-4**: Opinion pieces, partisan outlets
- **1-2**: Unverified claims, known misinformation sources

**Bias Assessment Categories:**

### 8. Policy Suggestions Table
**Purpose:** Develop actionable suggestions tied to the POSIT.

**Structure:**

| Policy Suggestion | Detail | Justification | Incentives Created | Opportunities for Grift | Second/Third-Order Consequences | Case Studies |
|-------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Universal Mandate with Wage Maintenance | Mandate 32-hour week across all sectors with maintained pay | Greatest equity impact; forces productivity innovation | Firms invest in automation; workers demand enforcement | Tax evasion schemes; fake compliance with paper trails | Capital flight to less-regulated markets; potential GDP contraction if productivity doesn't adjust | France's 35-hour week (1999) |

**Guidelines:**
- **Incentives Created:** What behaviors does this policy reward or encourage?
- **Opportunities for Grift:** Where could corruption or exploitation occur?
- **Second-Order:** Immediate downstream effects
- **Third-Order:** Longer-term systemic changes
- **Case Studies:** Real-world precedents (even imperfect analogies)

---

### 9. Second and Third-Order Consequences Table

**Structure:**

| Action | First-Order Effect | Second-Order Effect | Third-Order Effect |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Mandate 4-day week with wage maintenance | Immediate business cost increase (~25% payroll per hour) | Smaller labor pool pushes wages up; acceleration of AI adoption | Labor market bifurcation: "good jobs" with 4-day weeks vs "bad jobs" without; political pressure for regulation |

---

### 10. Narrative Analysis
**Purpose:** Synthesize all findings into a cohesive argument.

**Structure:**
- **Length:** 800-1,200 words
- **Tone:** Rigorous but accessible (undergraduate reading level)
- **Content:**
  - Introduce the question and stakes
  - Present the case for optimism (steel-man the positive view)
  - Present the case for skepticism (steel-man the concerns)
  - Explore nuance, trade-offs, and interdependencies

---

### 11. Conclusions
**Purpose:** Summarise findings and demonstrate intellectual diversity.

**Structure:**

```markdown
## Conclusions

### Lead Author: [Name]
**Position:** A phased sectoral approach is most viable—begin with government departments, extend to demonstrably feasible sectors (tech, finance), exempt critical infrastructure, and provide transition subsidies.

**Rationale:** Universal mandates risk economic shock given UK's fragmented labor market. Voluntary adoption won't achieve scale. Sectoral rollouts mirror Germany's successful labor regulations and allow empirical testing before expansion.

**Open Questions:**
- Will productivity gains persist beyond Hawthorne effects?
- Can gig economy workers be protected without stifling flexibility?

---

### Contributing Expert: [Name] (if applicable)
[Alternative conclusion if multiple authors]
```

**Tools:**
- Recharts (for interactive charts)
